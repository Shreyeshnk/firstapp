            Shree Ram is a central figure in Hinduism,
             revered as the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu.
              He was born in Ayodhya,
               married Sita, and went into exile for 14 years due to a family conflict.
                During his exile, Sita was abducted by the demon king Ravana,
                 leading to a war in which Ram emerged victorious, rescuing Sita. 
                 He then returned to Ayodhya, where he was crowned king. 
                 Ram's life embodies virtues like righteousness and duty,
                  and his story is celebrated in the epic Ramayana, 
                  serving as a model for righteous living and devotion.
